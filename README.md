# Data Structures in Linux Kernel(From MOOC)

The initial purpose of this project is to get familiar with the data structures in Linux Kernel.
Linux Kernel is ~~one of~~ the most complicated C project ever, I believe. ~~Many~~ MMMAAANNNYYY advanced data structures and ~~good~~ astonishing techniques are adopted in it.
* Unlocked list, doubly list
* B+ Trees
* Priority Queues
* RB Trees
* Priority Heap
* Hash Functions
* AVL Trees
* Radis Trees
* DFS/BFS
* sephmore, mutex...
* KMP(I thought KMP will never be used in real product before)
* Many sorting....
